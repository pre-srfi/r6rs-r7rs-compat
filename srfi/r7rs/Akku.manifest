   "Akku.scm has the ability to convert R7RS define-library forms to R6RS library forms. This package provides the R7RS standard library for use with such converted libraries."
   "Chez or Guile is required for full support."
   "Akku.scm 0.3.0 or later is required. When used with Akku 1.0.0 or later it does not conflict with the built-in support in Larceny and Sagittarius.")
